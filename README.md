# DnD Combat Tracker (5e)

Here is a link to the latest release: https://github.com/stephenDiosDev/DnD-Combat-Tracker/releases

A minimalist combat tracker for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (desktop java app).

The idea behind this is a very quick and easy "Plug and Play" design. You can simply plug
in the names and initiatives (and HP's for enemies) of anyone in your combat encounter,
and within a seconds you can easily and quickly track the progress of the encounter.
