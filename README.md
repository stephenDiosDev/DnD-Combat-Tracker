# DnD Combat Tracker (5e)
A minimalist combat tracker for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (desktop java app).

To start the program, ensure you have Java JRE installed (1.8+), and find the combatTracker.jar file (dndCombatTracker/combatTracker.jar).
Double click this .jar and the program should simply start.

Formatting for names and initiative and other controls:
Names can have any letters/numbers/symbols you want, but names have a hard cap on how many characters
can be displayed, and names only count as "good" as long as the name box is non-empty. Intiatives and
healths both can only be integers.

You can use TAB to navigate through all the ally boxes, followed by the enemy boxes.

Empty boxes simply get ignored, so add as many ally/enemy's as you wish!

Badly formatted names, initiatives and healths also get ignored.

When you are in the encounter page, pressing ESC will end the encounter immediately.
