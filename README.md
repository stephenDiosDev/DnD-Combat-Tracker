# DnD Combat Tracker (5e)
A minimalist combat tracker for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (desktop java app).

To start the program, ensure you have Java JRE installed (1.8+), and find the combatTracker.jar file (dndCombatTracker/combatTracker.jar).
Double click this .jar and the program should simply start.

Formatting for names and initiative and other controls:
When you enter a name and initiative, it must be in this format inside the text box: name,INITIATIVE
where a comma separates the name and initiative. Names can have spaces, numbers, etc but initiatives must
be an integer.

You can use TAB to navigate through all the ally boxes, followed by the enemy name/initiative and health.

Empty boxes simply get ignored, so add as many ally/enemy's as you wish!
Badly formatted names and initiatives also get ignored.

When you are in the encounter page, pressing ESC will end the encounter immediately.
